> [!WARNING]
> Currently, the library is still work in progress and very incomplete, which is why there is currently no
> documentation. You are free to use this library in it's current state if you wish to, however, if you do so, you will
> need to figure things out on your own. (You can ask on our discord server if you do need help.)
