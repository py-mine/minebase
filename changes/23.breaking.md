The `load_common_data` and `load_version` functions now returns custom pydantic objects instead of `dict`. This means support for `__getitem__` based accessing of the data (e.g. `load_common_data()["legacy"]["blocks"]`) will no longer work, in favor of attribute-based accessing (e.g. `load_common_data().legacy.blocks`). Additionally, to make sure we follow python's best practices, any camelCase attributes were converted into snake_case.
